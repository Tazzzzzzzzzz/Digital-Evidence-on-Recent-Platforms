# Digital Evidence on Recent Platforms

Project, that allowed users to upload JPG files, and EXIF data would be extracted from the file. This data would show location data and other image data, such as device data. The location data could then be plotted on a map. Several images could be uplaoded at once, and an interactive map would illustrate the location of where each image was taken.
